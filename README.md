Ever since https://hackaday.io/project/18648-nokia-3310-5110-display-board I've wanted to slap on an ESP module and some buttons to make a nice little portable handheld. Now with some googling and checking out other projects how they get their stuff done and a bit time on hand while on vacation I'm using every spare minute to work on this PCB. There are some minor things I'm not sure about that need testing, but the general concept is clear.

The last version - R 3.2.3 - seems to got lost, it was rebranded to Game Toy and some pinouts were changed to make more sense.
